// This page contains the information for the next week.

import Foundation

// It has arrays that contain the names and pictures for the week's recipes
// It currently also contains the data for each recipe's detail view in an array for the week.
// I think that there is a better way to do this
// We may also want to use this area to save if each day is on or off and the servings for each meal
// If we do that, we will also need to push this data from "next week" into "this week" when the week switches, so that the user's data is saved.

//// The name and image title for each day of the week
// nextWeekMealPicturesArray
// nextWeekMealNamesArray


// nextWeekCookThisDayArray (boolean array with default to TRUE for each day unless user turns off)
// nextWeekPrepTimeArray
// nextWeekCookTimeArray
// nextWeekServingsArray (all default except for user changes)
// nextWeekDescriptionArray
