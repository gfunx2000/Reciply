// This page contains the information for the current week.

import Foundation

// This page currently also contains the data for each recipe's detail view in an array for the week.
// I think that there is a better way to do this
// We may also want to use this area to save if each day is on or off and the servings for each meal
// If we do that, we will also need to pull the data from "next week" into "this week" when the week switches, so that the user's data is saved.

//// The name and image title for each day of the current week
// thisWeekMealNamesArray
// thisWeekMealPicturesArray


// ThisWeekCookThisDayArray (boolean array with default to TRUE for each day unless user turns off)
// thisWeekPrepTimeArray
// thisWeekCookTimeArray
// thisWeekServingsArray (all default except for user changes)
// thisWeekDescriptionArray
